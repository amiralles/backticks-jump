# backticks-jump
A small Sublime Text plugin to quickly jump back and forth between the previous and next cursor positions. (It works similarly to vim's bultin backtick-backtick command.)


### Installation
At the moment, there is no "official" package to install this plugin, but you can still uset it by copying `backticks_jump.py` into `<Sublime's Installation Path>/Packages/User`

Once you did that, just add a shortcut to run the `backticks_jump` and jump back and forth.

```
{ "keys": ["ctrl+,"], "command": "backticks_jump"}
```

### TODO
Create a package so that it's easier to install.
